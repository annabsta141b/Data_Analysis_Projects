## 1. Breast Cancer Diagnosis Modeling

  Cells are the basic unit that make up a human body. They can grow and divide to make new cells as the body needs them. When cells die, new ones will take their place. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that causes uncontrollable growth of abnormal breast cells that form a mass called a tumor.Benign tumors tend to grow slowly and do not spread while malignant tumors grow rapidly, invade, and destroy nearby normal tissues, and spread throughout the body (Cancer, 2019). The continued support for breast cancer awareness has helped create advances in diagnosis and in treatments. 
  
### Project Goal
  The main goal of this project is to build a model and find the most significant variables when determining tumor diagnosis.  We will then try and interpret our predictors to see how they affect tumor diagnosis. 

### Data Description
[Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

This dataset consists of the tumor diagnosis and the characteristics of cell nucleus, computed from 569 digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) breast mass. Assume that a breast mass can have more than one cell nucleus. There are 10 numeric predictors which describe the size and shape of the cell nucleus for each image. The size of the cell nucleus described by the predictors radius, area, and perimeter while the shape of the cell nuclei is described by the predictors texture, smoothness, concavity, compactness, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.  The mean, worst (mean of the three largest values), and standard error of these 10 predictors and were computed for each image, resulting in a total of 30 predictors. The response variable is a binary categorical variable that describes the diagnosis of the tumor as either benign or malignant.
